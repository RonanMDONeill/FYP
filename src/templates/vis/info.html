These visualizations are interactive, so you can move them around, zoom in and out, and highlight selected nodes. Once a node has been selected, you can find more information about it in a box to the left. Also to the left, you may also find a selection of publications and authors we think you may be interested in. These recommendations are generated from co-authors and shared references within your collection. The four types are visualizations are described below.</h2>
