# COMP30910 - FYP Design and Implementation
Final year Computer Science with Data Science project.

## PaperMill: A Visual Interface for Managing Research Paper Collections
An essential aspect of the writing process of a literature review is building a collection of relevant papers regarding the topic at hand. This allows a researcher to develop a keen and broad understanding of past work and analysis undertaken. There are many tools available that visualize relationships between academic papers based on properties including citations, authors, and references. However, what these tools lack is the ability to find individual papers within these visualizations, or a recommender system based on a previously established collection.  Using a specially curated dataset containing over four million academic papers, this project will develop a tool that will not only visualize the relationships between publications but will also help users find papers relevant to their search, thanks to an in-built recommender system. The aim of this tool is to expedite the writing process of a literature review, by shortening the time a researcher spends searching for pertinent papers.

## Project Specification
The main objective of this project is to build a visualization tool that shows the relationship between literature reviews. As well as that, it will also contain a recommender system based on various factors. The project specification is broken down into two sections; core and advanced. The core specifications are the basic, yet essential features included in the tool. These features will be focused on first. The advanced specifications refer to the more complex features that will be developed once the core features are properly implemented. Below is a list of the core and advanced specifications.
Core:
•	Using an appropriate dataset, build a database of papers including metadata, citation graph, publication location, and co-author information.
•	Build a visual tool to illustrate the connections between a collection of research papers.
•	Allow the user to highlight different types of connections between papers (co-authorship, cited, cited-by, etc.).
•	Use the citation graph to recommend papers to a user based on papers collected already by the researcher.
•	Collect feedback from trial users on the usefulness of the tool. 
Advanced:
•	Handle visualization of the network of papers and time in an elegant and intuitive way.
•	Use text mining techniques to make content-based recommendations.
•	Develop a feature to suggest appropriate publication venues to researchers based on the content of a new paper.
•	Allow a user to provide ratings for papers and make recommendations based on these ratings.
•	Connect to existing platforms such as Google Scholar, ResearchGate etc. to ingest a researcher's paper collections.
•	A completed, well designed controlled user trial that evaluates the usefulness of the tool.
